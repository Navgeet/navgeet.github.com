So I finally bit the bullet and published my first blog post, however little sense it may make.

The raison d'Ãªtre of this blog is to document my journey into the software world, mostly remaining in the comforting clojure zone, and a recent foray in the fascinating field of artificial intelligence.

I've lately been researching [Inductive Logic Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming) (aka ILP), a fascinating technique to induce first-order hypothesis from first-order examples. Much like what Machine Learning achieves for propositional examples, albeit being much less powerful than ILP, and consequently much simpler. I hope to document some of my learnings in this blog over the next year.

Till next time.
